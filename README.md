## Getting Started

Run the following two commands to install Xcode's command line tools and bundler, if you don't have that yet.

```bash
[sudo] gem install bundler
xcode-select --install
```

The following commands will clone the repo and install all the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivanbruel/SwipeIt.git
cd SwipeIt
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Now you can open `SwipeIt.xcworkspace` and Run the `SwipeIt` target onto your simulator or iOS device.

You can also run the tests by calling:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane ios test
```

## Code style

This project will follow the [GitHub Swift Styleguide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) in every way possible.

In order to enforce this, the project will also have a [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) build phase to run the linter everytime the app is built.

Variable naming conventions will be ignored whenever a **RxSwift**-based variable is created (as the naming convention of the library is to start it with **rx_** (e.g. `rx_contentOffset`).

## Project Structure

The project follows this folder structure:

```
SwipeIt
├── App
│   └── AppDelegate
├── Enums
├── Extensions
├── Externals
├── Globals
├── Helpers
├── Models
├── Networking
├── Protocols
├── Resources
│   ├── LaunchScreen.storyboard
│   ├── Localizable.strings
│   └── Info.plist
├── Structs
├── ViewControllers
│   ├── Onboarding
│   │     └── Onboarding.storyboard
│   └── Main
│         └── Main.storyboard
├── ViewModels
└── Views
```

In order to enforce it to the filesystem we're using [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx) to keep the folder structures clean and mirroring the project structure.

## Continuous Integration

We are using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ivanbruel/MVVM-Benchmark) alongside [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to perform continuous integration both by unit testing and deploying to [Fabric](https://fabric.io) or [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com) later on.

### Environment variables

To make sure Fabric and iTunes can deploy, make sure you have them set to something similar to the following environment variables. **The values are only examples!**.

**Note:** For ENV variables to work in Xcode you to set `$ defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode UseSanitizedBuildSystemEnvironment -bool NO` and launch Xcode from the terminal. [Apple Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/8451)

### Deployment to iTunes Connect

## Yet another Reddit app

This application is being developed as a side project in an effort to benchmark MVVM vs. MVC architectures, you can read more about it in [Medium](https://medium.com/faber-dev/mvvm-benchmark-in-an-mvc-world-part-1-dab952617395) and in our [MVVM vs. MVC README](https://github.com/ivanbruel/SwipeIt/blob/master/MVVM-MVC.md)

## Contributing

Should anyone want to contribute to this long-term benchmark, feel free to do pull requests, open up issues and even join me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ivanbruel) to discuss the architecture.
